- Hey! Iâ€™m JP, a very passionate Computer Science student, and an aspiring Game Developer/Software Engineer!
- I am obsessed with Linux! I am currently using Fedora, but I've also been on Ubuntu, Pop!\_OS and openSUSE.
- I'm interested in a lot of things, but I'd say my two major drivers are ensuring accessibility, and contributing to open source software.  Accessibility is really important to me, and I know how small design choices go a long way. As a colorblind person myself, I appreciate a well thought of design. And I want to know that anyone needing to use any software I write can use it regardless of their disability. An essential playlist to me is [Designing for Disability](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLc38fcMFcV_vvWOhMDriBlVocTZ8mKQzR), I heavily encourage you to check it out. 
While game development is a major passion of mine, I also am eager to dig into more fields as a more general software engineer, especially seeing where I fit best in the Linux community.

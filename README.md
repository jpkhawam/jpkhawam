- ðŸ‘‹ Hey! Iâ€™m Jean-Paul Khawam, a very passionate Computer Science student. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m mostly interested in Game Development (Currently learning Godot!), and I'm trying to shape my path 
to allow me to contribute as much as possible to Open Source Software.
- :fire: I am OBSESSED with Linux! I am currently using openSUSE TumbleWeed, but I've also been on Ubuntu, Pop!_OS and Fedora!
This is all making me very eager to contribute one day alongside these Foundations/Companies, especially Red Hat :wink:
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning 
  + Godot & GDScript
  + Kotlin
  + Continuing the never ending journey of C++
- ðŸ“« How to reach me

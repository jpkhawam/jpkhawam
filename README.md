- ðŸ‘‹ Hey! Iâ€™m Jean-Paul Khawam, a very passionate Computer Science student, and an aspiring Game Developer/Software Engineer!

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m mostly interested in Game Development (Currently learning Godot!), while trying to shape my path 
in a way that allows me to contribute as much as possible to Open Source Software.

- :fire: I am OBSESSED with Linux! I am currently using Kubuntu, but I've also been on Ubuntu, Pop!\_OS and openSUSE TumbleWeed,
which makes me very eager to contribute one day alongside these Foundations/Companies, especially Red Hat and System76 :wink:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning 
  + Determined to master C++, major thanks to [LearnCpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com), check them out!
  + Godot & GDScript, thanks to [GDQuest on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/Gdquest)
  + Finishing my third (and final) year of Bachelor's at the Lebanese University

- ðŸ“† My long term plan:
I'm interested in a lot of things, but I'd say my two major drivers are ensuring accessibility, and contributing to open source software.  Accessibility is really important to me, and I know how small design choices go a long way. As a colorblind person myself, I appreciate a well thought of design. And I want to know that anyone needing to use any software I write can use it regardless of their disability. An essential playlist to me is [Designing for Disability](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLc38fcMFcV_vvWOhMDriBlVocTZ8mKQzR), I heavily encourage you to check it out. 
While game development is a major passion of mine, I also am eager to dig into more fields as a more general software engineer, especially seeing where I fit best in the Linux community.

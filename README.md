- ðŸ‘‹ Hey! Iâ€™m Jean-Paul Khawam, a very passionate Computer Science student, and an aspiring Game Developer! 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m mostly interested in Game Development (Currently learning Godot!), and I'm trying to shape my path 
in a way that allows me to contribute as much as possible to Open Source Software.
- :fire: I am OBSESSED with Linux! I am currently using Kubuntu, but I've also been on Ubuntu, Pop!\_OS and openSUSE TumbleWeed!
Which is making me very eager to contribute one day alongside these Foundations/Companies, especially Red Hat and System76 :wink:
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning 
  + Godot & GDScript thanks to [GDQuest on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/Gdquest)
  + Continuing the never ending journey of C++ thanks to [LearnCpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com)
  + Finishing my third (and final) year of Bachelor's at the Lebanese University

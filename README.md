- Hey! I’m Jean-Paul Khawam, a very passionate Computer Science student, and an aspiring Game Developer/Software Engineer!
- I am OBSESSED with Linux! I am currently using openSUSE, but I've also been on Ubuntu, Pop!\_OS and Fedora.
I'm very eager to contribute one day alongside these companies, especially Red Hat and System76
- I’m currently learning 
  + C++, thanks to [LearnCpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com)
  + Godot & GDScript, thanks to [GDQuest on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/Gdquest)
  + Finishing my last year of Bachelor's at the Lebanese University
- My long term plan:
I'm interested in a lot of things, but I'd say my two major drivers are ensuring accessibility, and contributing to open source software.  Accessibility is really important to me, and I know how small design choices go a long way. As a colorblind person myself, I appreciate a well thought of design. And I want to know that anyone needing to use any software I write can use it regardless of their disability. An essential playlist to me is [Designing for Disability](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLc38fcMFcV_vvWOhMDriBlVocTZ8mKQzR), I heavily encourage you to check it out. 
While game development is a major passion of mine, I also am eager to dig into more fields as a more general software engineer, especially seeing where I fit best in the Linux community.
